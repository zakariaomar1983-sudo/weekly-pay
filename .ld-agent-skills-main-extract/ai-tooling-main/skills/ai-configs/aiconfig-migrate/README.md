# LaunchDarkly AI Config Migrate Skill

An Agent Skill for migrating an application with hardcoded LLM prompts to a full LaunchDarkly AI Configs implementation in five stages: extract, wrap, tools, tracking, evals.

## Overview

This skill orchestrates the full migration journey from hardcoded `openai.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o", ...)` (or equivalent in any provider SDK) to a managed AI Config with tools, tracking, and judges. It delegates each stage to a focused skill and covers the tracker wiring inline — since no existing skill owns `tracker.track_*` calls.

The five stages:

1. **Extract** hardcoded model names, prompts, and parameters (read-only)
2. **Wrap** the call site in `completion_config` / `completionConfig` with a safe fallback — delegates the config creation to `aiconfig-create`
3. **Tools** — move function-calling schemas into LaunchDarkly — delegates to `aiconfig-tools`
4. **Tracking** — wire `track_duration`, `track_tokens`, `track_success`/`track_error`, optional `track_feedback` — inline, with a reference doc covering every SDK method in Python and Node side by side
5. **Evals** — attach judges for LLM-as-a-judge scoring — delegates to `aiconfig-online-evals`

## Installation (Local)

Copy `skills/ai-configs/aiconfig-migrate/` into your agent client's skills path.

## Prerequisites

- Remotely hosted LaunchDarkly MCP server
- `LD_SDK_KEY` environment variable (server-side SDK key, starts with `sdk-`)
- An application with hardcoded LLM calls (OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, or Strands)

## Usage

```
Migrate our chat service from hardcoded OpenAI prompts to LaunchDarkly AI Configs
```

```
Our LangGraph agent has its model and instructions baked in — walk me through wrapping it in an AI Config
```

```
Wire up the AI tracker and attach accuracy + relevance judges to our existing config
```
