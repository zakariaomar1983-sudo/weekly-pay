# LaunchDarkly AI Config Projects Skill

An Agent Skill for setting up LaunchDarkly project management in a codebase. Guides exploration of the stack, assessment of the right approach, and integration that fits the architecture.

## Overview

This skill teaches agents how to:
- Explore the codebase to understand the tech stack and patterns
- Assess what project setup approach makes sense
- Choose the right implementation path (by language, use case, or tooling)
- Create projects and save SDK keys via API or MCP
- Verify the setup via API fetch and SDK integration test

## Installation (Local)

For now, install by placing this skill directory where your agent client loads skills.

Examples:

- **Generic**: copy `skills/ai-configs/aiconfig-projects/` into your client's skills path

## Prerequisites

**Choose one:**
- LaunchDarkly API access token with `projects:write` permission
- LaunchDarkly MCP server configured in your environment

## Usage

Once installed, the skill activates automatically when you ask about project setup:

```
Set up a LaunchDarkly project for our AI configs
```

```
Create a project for our customer support agent
```

```
Add LaunchDarkly project management to this codebase
```
