# LaunchDarkly Agent Skills

LaunchDarkly's public collection of AI agent skills and playbooks. These skills encode repeatable workflows for working with LaunchDarkly, so coding agents can execute common tasks safely and consistently.

## What Is This Repo?

Agent Skills are modular, text-based playbooks that teach an agent how to perform a workflow. This repo is designed to be a public, open-source home for LaunchDarkly skills and to align with the emerging Agent Skills Open Standard.

## Install as a Claude Code Plugin

This repo is a [Claude Code plugin](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/create-plugins). Installing it gives you all the skills above plus the LaunchDarkly MCP server.

1. Open Claude Code and run `/plugin install`.
2. Search for **LaunchDarkly**, or install directly from the repo URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/launchdarkly/ai-tooling
   ```
3. Authenticate the LaunchDarkly MCP server when prompted with your [API access token](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/account/api).

Once installed, skills are available as `/launchdarkly:<skill-name>` across all your projects, and the MCP server can read and modify your flags directly.

### Onboarding

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `onboarding` | End-to-end LaunchDarkly setup: kickoff roadmap, MCP, SDK install, first flag |
| `onboarding/mcp-configure` | Configure the LaunchDarkly hosted MCP server (OAuth, no API keys needed) |
| `onboarding/sdk-install` | Install and initialize the correct SDK via detect, plan, and apply sub-steps |
| `onboarding/first-flag` | Create a boolean flag, evaluate it, toggle on/off for end-to-end proof |

## Install as a Cursor Plugin

This repo is a [Cursor plugin](https://cursor.com/docs/plugins/building). Installing it gives you all the skills above plus the LaunchDarkly MCP server, so the agent can read and modify your flags directly.

1. Open Cursor and go to **Settings > Plugins**.
2. Search for **LaunchDarkly** in the marketplace, or install from the repo URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/launchdarkly/ai-tooling
   ```
Once installed, the skills and MCP server are available across all your projects.

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/launchdarkly/ai-tooling.git
cd ai-tooling

# If your agent supports skills.sh installs:
npx skills add launchdarkly/ai-tooling

# Or manually copy a skill into your agent's skills path:
cp -r skills/feature-flags/launchdarkly-flag-cleanup <your-agent-skills-dir>/

```

Then ask your agent something like:

```
Which feature flags are stale and should be cleaned up?
```

```
Create a feature flag for the new checkout flow
```

```
Roll out dark-mode to 25% of users in production
```

```
Remove the `new-checkout-flow` feature flag from this codebase
```

## Install via skills.sh CLI

```bash
npx skills add <owner/repo>
```
